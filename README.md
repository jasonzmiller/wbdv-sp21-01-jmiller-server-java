- Had troubles using SpringBoot to deploy to Heroku, so I began the project using Jannunzi's repo (at the guidance of TA Sana Jahan).
- I implemented the dashboard using a table. I began working on the grid implementation, but I didn't think I'd have time to finish before the assignment was due. In future assignments, I will most likely use the grid.
